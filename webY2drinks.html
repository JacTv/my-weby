            <br><h1>2. Ceylon Black Tea</h1>
            <br><p>Ceylon tea is a name given to tea produced in Sri Lanka. Ceylon is the former name for Sri Lanka that is still used in the tea trade. The tea gardens are spread throughout the island, and the favorable climate allows an all-year harvest.

                <br><br>Most production is oriented towards black tea, and the best examples of Ceylon black tea come from higher elevation tea gardens located in the center of the island. Altitude has the most significant effect on the final character of Ceylon teas. Low-grown teas are mostly used in blends and provide a firm body and good strength.

                Mid-grown teas—typically cultivated between 2,000 and 3,500 feet—are full-bodied and have a rich and complex flavor.</p>

            <br><h1>3. Chai masala</h1>
            <br><p>Chai masala is an aromatic beverage originating from India. It is made with a combination of sweetened black tea and milk that is spiced with a masala mix—which typically includes cardamom, ground ginger, cloves, cinnamon, and black peppercorns.

                <br><br>However, the choice and the exact proportion of spices often vary. Although there are several theories that claim otherwise, the origin of chai masala is mostly associated with the British tea trade. In the 19th century, the Chinese had a monopoly on the tea trade, and the British looked for other markets that would fulfill the high demand for black tea—which was a firm European favorite.</p>

            <br><h1>6. Salep</h1>
            <br><p>Turkish salep is a beverage that is usually consumed during the winter season.
